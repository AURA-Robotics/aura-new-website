        <h1>Our site has changed!</h1>
        <p>Due to hosting costs and the changing needs of our club, we no longer maintain an active blog and therefore have changed to a static website.</p>
        <p>If you're looking for a blog post or page from the old site, an archived snapshot of the website can still be found at <a href="https://aura-robotics.github.io/aura.org.nz/index.html">https://aura-robotics.github.io/aura.org.nz/index.html</a>.</p>
